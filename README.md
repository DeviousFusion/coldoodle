### Introduction
Marlin is a firmware for RepRap 3D printers, the software that resides on the controller board and controls the input/output, voltage states, and movement of the 3D printer. It runs specifically on the Arduino platform. Depending on configuration options, the size of the Marlin binary image may be anywhere from 50K to over 200K. It supports a huge number of features, such as:

Servos for bed probing
Automatic Bed leveling
Manual Bed Leveling
